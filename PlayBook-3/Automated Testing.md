## Test Frameworks:
- unittest
- pytest
```python
pipenv install --dev pytest
pipenv install --dev pytest-django
```
Create a new dir tests in app
Now, Create new file test_collection (the name of convention should be same), the name of the test should be start with test other wise pytest can't detect.
