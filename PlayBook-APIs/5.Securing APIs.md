## Securing APIs:
Authentications, Login, Tokens, Permissions, and much much more
## Token-based authentication:
Such as a Temporary key sent by the Server
## Adding authentication Endpoints
Django does not have a layer for APIs, which is unfortunate. Use the library below for all we need in one go. Djoser is an API layer
### DJOSER***
```python
pipenv install djoser
```
- See All Documentation to install Djoser.
###### AUTH-ENGINES:
1. token-based 2. JSON web token
