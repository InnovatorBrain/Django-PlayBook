## Build API
### Designing Phase
This means How it works Operations, get, add, update, remove, etc
Operations like 
POST, GET, DELETE, PATCH, DELETE ...
### Check the Data Model 
@models.py
A Hacker can access Django self-contained IDs because of sequence numbers. Solution is bellow
#### GUID: Globally Unique Identifier
    from uuid import uuid4
    class Cart(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid4)
For no duplicate in the same cart the same product

        class Meta:
        unique_together = [['cart', 'product']]
