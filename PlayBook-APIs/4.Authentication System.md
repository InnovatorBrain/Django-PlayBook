# Django Authentication System
## If the database is crashed
    DROP DATABASE bytzendatabase;
    CREATE DATABASE bytzendatabase;
### Extending User
(To keep track of authentication-related attributes.)
- User
- App User
### Create Profile
(For storing non-authentication related attributes.)
- Profile
- User
## Extending the User Model:
Could you check the table of auth-user for a unique column that can be customized?
- Make a new app core.

        @core.models.py
        from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
        from django.db import models
        class User(AbstractUser):
        email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
        @settings.py
        AUTH_USER_MODEL = "core.User"
        @admin.py
        from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin as BaseUserAdmin
        @admin.register(User)
        class UserAdmin(BaseUserAdmin):
        add_fieldsets = (
        (None, {
            'classes': ('wide',),
            'fields': ('username', 'password1', 'password2', 'email', 'first_name', 'last_name'),
        }),
        )
## Creating User Profile:
Add a new field to the customer model for a link to a specific user that we have defined before | it will inherit defined fields from the user model and We don't need those fields in our customer models anymore. You can set up the Referring and Lookup fields as you wish.
      
    from django.conf import settings
    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

## Groups and Permissions:
The group is a collection of permissions 

## Creating Custom Permissions:
For Customized permission for specific models
suppose order Model:

    class Meta:
        Permissions = [
            ('cancel_oders', 'Can cancel order'), 
        ]





# Django Authentication System

## Database Management
In case the database needs to be reset, you can drop and recreate it:

```python
DROP DATABASE bytzendatabase;
CREATE DATABASE bytzendatabase;
Extending the User Model
To include additional authentication-related attributes, you can extend the User model with a new app called "core."

Create a new app called core.

core/models.py

python
Copy code
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class User(AbstractUser):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
Update your settings.py to specify the custom user model.

settings.py

python
Copy code
AUTH_USER_MODEL = "core.User"
Customize the User Admin to include email when creating a new user.

admin.py

python
Copy code
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin as BaseUserAdmin
from .models import User

@admin.register(User)
class UserAdmin(BaseUserAdmin):
    add_fieldsets = (
        (None, {
            'classes': ('wide',),
            'fields': ('username', 'password1', 'password2', 'email', 'first_name', 'last_name'),
        }),
    )
Creating User Profile
To store non-authentication related attributes, you can create a user profile. This profile will be linked to a specific user and inherit the defined fields from the user model.

python
Copy code
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models

class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # Add additional profile fields here
Groups and Permissions
Groups in Django are collections of permissions that can be assigned to users.

Creating Custom Permissions
For customized permissions specific to certain models (e.g., the Order model), define them in the model's Meta class.

python
Copy code
class Order(models.Model):
    # Your order fields here

    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ('cancel_orders', 'Can cancel orders'),
            # Add more custom permissions as needed
        ]
