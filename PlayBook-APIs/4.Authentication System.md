# Django Authentication System
## If the database is crashed
    DROP DATABASE bytzendatabase;
    CREATE DATABASE bytzendatabase;
### Extending User
(To keep track of authentication-related attributes.)
- User
- App User
### Create Profile
(For storing non-authentication related attributes.)
- Profile
- User
## Extending the User Model:
Could you check the table of auth-user for a unique column that can be customized?
- Make a new app core.

        @core.models.py
        from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
        from django.db import models
        class User(AbstractUser):
        email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
        @settings.py
        AUTH_USER_MODEL = "core.User"
        @admin.py
        from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin as BaseUserAdmin
        @admin.register(User)
        class UserAdmin(BaseUserAdmin):
        add_fieldsets = (
        (None, {
            'classes': ('wide',),
            'fields': ('username', 'password1', 'password2', 'email', 'first_name', 'last_name'),
        }),
        )
## Creating User Profile:
Add a new field to the customer model for a link to a specific user that we have defined before | it will inherit defined fields from the user model and We don't need those fields in our customer models anymore. You can set up the Referring and Lookup fields as you wish.
      
    from django.conf import settings
    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

## Groups and Permissions:
The group is a collection of permissions 

## Creating Custom Permissions:
For Customized permission for specific models
suppose order Model:
    ```
    class Meta:
        Permissions = [
            ('cancel_oders', 'Can cancel order'), 
        ]
    ```
